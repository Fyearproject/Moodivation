Problem Statement:
The main motto of this project is to design an android based application which will provide us with a small group of quotes. That quote can be related to any mood/emotion/expression, the person has to just select the category i.e the key words provided. If the person is done reading the quote on that particular page they can refresh the screen , several different quotes will be displayed by just scrolling the screen downwards. 
Now, the sharing feature will also be added by which the person can share the particular quote in any form i.e by copying the quote to the keyboard or by sending it directly in any application installed in that android system. The performed action by the user will be recorded in their respected database.
Project Brief Description:
Quotes are basically a collection of words used to express certain feeling which comes from another person with credit acknowledgment. It has been a major source of expressing an individual’s mindset. This app is about the development of quotes according to the person’s mood.
This app is for anyone looking for a large collection of quotes. The app comes with a minimal home screen and the quotes are segregated into categories of emotions like sad, happy, motivational, love, success, etc . Tapping on the categories gives you a list of quotes that you can copy and share straightaway either as a text or an image on social media.

Project Features:
	Search quotes using given categories. 
	Refresh screen.
	Share Quotes.
	Copy quotes to clipboards.
	Database records. 




Android Topics/Libraries to be Used:
In this project, to complete several requirements there will be some libraries to carry a certain task.
There will be  ‘recyclerview’ to show image in a list. RecyclerView is the ViewGroup that contains the views corresponding to your data. It's a view itself, so you add RecyclerView into your layout the way you would add any other UI element. Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object.
Next, there is constraint layout or relative layout to display the fetched data. Constraint Layout provides you the ability to completely design your UI with the drag and drop feature provided by the Android Studio design editor. It helps to improve the UI performance over other layouts. With the help of ConstraintLayout, we can control the group of widgets through a single line of code. Relative Layout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions.
Swiperefreshlayout for swipe down to refresh on homepage. Android SwipeRefreshLayout is a ViewGroup that can hold only one scrollable child. It can be either a ScrollView, ListView or RecyclerView. 
Lifecycle library to retain the information when device is rotated. Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.

Database Used:
•	SQLite
